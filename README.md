This is my Hyprland dotfiles for ArcoLinux+Hyprland setup. Feel free to fork them.

They should work on any distro, provided you have the following packages installed (because I've used them in the scripts):
```
hyprcursor
hypridle
hyprland
hyprland-qt-support
hyprland-qtutils
hyprlang
hyprlock
hyprpaper
hyprshot
hyprsunset
hyprutils
hyprwayland-scanner
qt5-wayland
xdg-desktop-portal-hyprland
polkit-gnome #you could replace this with any polkit agent, like hyprpolkitagent
```
**All the other packages should get installed as dependencies to these, so don't worry**

I'll screenshots soon, so you know how this rice looks.
No installation scripts yet (because if I add one without thorough testing, I know you'll curse me)
